Hi!
I'm Luis Edgar Dom√≠nguez Llanos.
I'm a marketing specialist who's also a full-stack web developer.

Whenever I'm not creating a strategic communication plan or developing IoT-enabled gadgets to deploy as viral playthings,
I can be found programming Shopify websites or full-on NodeJS servers from scratch.

I have also won musical programming contests, and am interested in musical composition.
